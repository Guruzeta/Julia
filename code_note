# The Goal for the code
1. Get n_k(t,t) for both phonons and electrons for larger t
2. Just simple 2 component dyson??????? - Is it the problem itself?


3. DR(t,t) = 0 exactly (not approximately)
Same for $\bar{D}_R$ = t,t value is exactly -1

4. Currently doing a non-self consistent for loop
5. For DK(i+1,i+1) case, we've to wait until we've GK(i,i+1), GR(i+1,i) i.e. non-diagonal entries on the new edges
6. dkbar[i,i] assignment should probably work, given I've SigmaR, DK + sigmaK, GR values on the edges of the i,i block and the on i-1,i-1 block too

7. DK Block seems correct
8. In Gr, GK, update, we're using the "same number" of phonon modes and same number of electron modes. Is that fair?
(probably)
9. For electrons, the Gr and Ga matrices are hermitian conj of each other, while for phonons they're just transpose of one another.
10. Had a made a mistake in Gr(t,t) Initialization - should be -i, instead of -1
(Make this Initialization stick) + Initialization in 2*2 box
11. Update GK(t+œµ,t+œµ) i.e GK(i+1,i+1) here  - needs Œ£‚Çë·¥ø on the i+1 block edges
i.e. ranging from i,0 to i,i+1
12. ^ also needs Œ£‚Çë·¥∑ on the i+1 block edges  i.e. ranging from i,0 to i,i+1
13. Now extract self energies Œ£‚Çë·¥ø,Œ£‚Çë·¥∑ in the n+1,n+1 block (shall be used for c
  alculation of GR in n+2,n+2 loop i.e. next big loop's
GR,GK update since you're dropping the self consistent term)
14. indexin shall only work for 1d BZ and needs to modified for higher d
15. Zero mode needed for summing the +-œÄ/a1 modes in calculation of the Œ£ùëù ≥
16. Issue at sumBZ1d = adding 2 and 3rd momenta gives 7th momenta - decimal
errors
17. # lesson - .$ where $ is a  binary operation is the julia equivalent of handling doing array +-* with a scalar on each element
18. -ve k is done for 1d.
19. What was the reason for ignoring the SigmaA* GA term in the evolution?
20. Dkbar[i,i] -Correct? (probably
21. I mistook k as momentum itself in definitions of energy and all the propagators. Should be replaced by V_ph[k]


### Checks
1. DK is a symmetric matrix
2. iGK is a hermitian matrix (or Gk is anti-hermitian))
3.  Currently doing a non-self consistent for loop
4.



### Need to put later: potential Causes of error
1. Not initializing the 2,2 index properly for now - Will see later
2. Dkbar[i,i] -Correct? (probably

daydreaming


## Debugging
1. something fishy happens after i=11, the values shoot up and just become 0

### Improvements
1. make it into separate files
















What AM I even avoiding? Times are tough. Sagnik made huge progress, all on his own. I managed to do little in terms of the code.
Continued this way, in all actuality, I feel like a dragging leg of the team. But there's a way out - have 5 meetings with results and
you may win back your spot. This means saying no to every obligation other than coding to code. And even on the times scheduled for
coding, this means straining yourself to ounce the very last decimal of perfection and accuracy. Be determined and don't waste your t
ime.

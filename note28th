What am I doing in my life these days:
1. Starting the work on Weyl semimetals and interfacial superconductivity
2. KFT: *starting to code in the project*
3. Possible problem on Coulomb drag????



What Do I want the results to look like:
1. Get into a Good grad school
2. Get good with advanced tools - really cultivate a familiarity with them as you've with conventional QM (Green's Functions - helpful in DDP, KFT, possibly too in AAZ)



What I should be doing:
1. 



BIG SUMMER GOALS
1. Get results on KFT (atleast meet 5 times with Rajdeep) - 5 presentable instances
Have 8 weeks till sem starts - I should try and meet with barring 3 weeks, I my goal should be to come up with something presentable each week
2. Complete Weyl Semimetal reading for the BTP, read the basic papers on the interfacial SC(atleast one) and have atleast 1st 3 chapters of your BTP written
3. Do some background reading on the coulomb drag problem
